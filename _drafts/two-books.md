title:  "Two Books that Changed My Life"
---

This year, I had the pleasure and luck of reading two books that I think changed my understanding of life. I decided to write about what resonated in my mind while reading them, as a personal log and possibly an incentive for others to give them a try. 

The two books are The Selfish Gene by Sir Richard Dawkins and Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari.

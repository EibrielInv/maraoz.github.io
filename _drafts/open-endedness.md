I've recently come accross the concept of **open-endedness** through [an introductory article](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/open-endedness-the-last-grand-challenge-youve-never-heard-of/) by Ken Stanley[^1]. I soon realized this was something I actually had been interested in since I was a child, and got excited to find a conceptual framework to think about it. 

In a nutshell, open-endedness is a property attributed to systems that forever generate unbounded complexity and interesting qualities. What defines unbounded complexity, you may ask? Who defines what's interesting and what not? How do we measure forever? These are questions even experts in open-endedness can't answer yet. Ken Stanley himself argued that [maybe the only valid method for evaluating open-endedness is subjective](http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/stanley_oee2workshop16.pdf).

Some *examples* of open-ended systems are: **biological evolution** (a single algorithm that generated all life and has been running for billions of years), **cells** (DNA-defined form and function), **the human brain** (with its capacity to create an apparently unbounded amount and variety of thoughts), **human cultures and civilization** (including music, art, and language), and **science** (a boundless refinement of models that predict the world increasingly well).

Surprisingly, [this definition of open-ended I found googling around](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/open-ended) is useful in understanding the implications of open-endedness:

>  **o·pen-end·ed** (ō′pən-ĕn′dĭd)
>  adj.
> 
>  1. Not restrained by definite limits, restrictions, or structure.
>  2. Allowing for or adaptable to change.
>  3. Inconclusive or indefinite.
>  4. Allowing for a spontaneous, unstructured response.

I'm personally fascinated by the topic because it combines the study of evolution, learning, could be a promising avenue to achieve human-level intelligence, and may even help untangle aspects of the biggest mystery: consciousness.

Since I read Ken's article about a month ago and put a name to it, I've been thinking a lot about open-endedness. It's a fuzzy concept, so I'm writing down my initial learnings and ideas to organize them, and hopefully inspire other people to think about it more clearly. 

## Order, Interestingness & Chaos

A core challenge of engineering open-endedness is the tension between order and chaos from which interesting things emerge. By some measures of complexity (for example, if you use information theory), chaos is very complex. A screen with random noise is very complex, but not very interesting. However, a very structured and orderly system (say, for comparison, a screen with a single color), may not be interesting either.

Interesting things seem to lie in a middle ground between order and chaos, and it's not very clear where the tipping point is on both ends. Most people would further argue that interestingness is in the eye of the beholder, and that it's a [phenomenological quality of an experience](https://www.fastcompany.com/90247237/what-makes-a-person-or-experience-interesting), not of objects themselves. 

I think there might be a close relation between attention, surprise, learning and interestingness. Let me try to sum it up. Attention seems to be the narrowing of our consciousness to surprising events (at least when we learn). Surprising events are simply events that our predictive models failed to correctly predict (because we're still learning). When something becomes boring, it's either because we can already predict it pretty well, or because we've given up trying to understand it. In the process of learning, we turn our attention to surprising events until we can predict them properly, and they become boring. This is also why the more we know about something, the less conscious we are to details: our attention moves to higher-level concepts and patterns[^2].


## Morphological vs Behavioral Open-Endedness

Systems can express open-endedness at two levels:
- **Morphologically**: that is, open-endedness of form.
- **Behaviorally**: open-endedness in function.
<img class="post-img" src="/img/open-endedness/1.jpg">

Let's take single cells as an example. Morphologically, they seem to be open-ended. Their form is defined by the DNA stored in the nucleus, which determines which proteins they produce. Very different kinds of cells all arise from a single mechanism that tranforms sequences of ACTG bases into aminoacids into proteins. 

However the very same mechanism produces a wide variety of interactions and functions. Cells can either be neurons, skin tissue, or sperm. There doesn't seem to be a clear bound on the complexity that cell behavior can attain (especially knowing that cells eventually evolved to cooperate into multicellular organisms).

This is why cells, as encoded in the DNA of their nucleus, are open-ended systems both morphologycally and behaviorally.

I suspect a requirement for morphological open-endedness might be **compositionality**. That is, that the system enables complex structures to be formed by the combination of simpler parts. 

On the other side, I suspect behavioral open-endedness is somehow tied to **computability**. If you think about it, both cells, brains, cultures and science all resemble computers in some way. Cells are almost literally tiny Turing machines, with the DNA as the tape. Brains are definitely computing.

## Generators and Substrates

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generator
Generator: substrate that generates open endedness 
Hyerarchical emergence of these properties may give rise to ever increasing o4e9
Can a generator generate a generator? 

## A Sound Theory of Open-Endedness™✨ 

comprehensive-explain phenomena
parsimonious-explain things concisely
falsifiable-able to be tested for correctness
productive-lead to new ideas, new predictions, and new research

can we define open-endedness inside a system?

A good theory of o4e9 should account for dna->cell->multicellular orgs->civilization.

Molecules compete with each other for stability
Cells compete with each other for resources. 
Multicellular orgs compete with each other for survival. 
Civilizations/cultures compete with each other for resources. 
Maybe science will create the next generator? 

## Final thoughts and future work


## A Strange Loop
open-endedness <=> consciousness ?
why don't we model the scientist looking at the open-ended simulation
like a GAN, but their attention span (how much they look at each world)
is a measure of how interesting the world is
maybe even the simulated actors can be the judges?


## Climbing life's tech stack
Behaviors in order of complexity:

- ability to appear naturally from environmental conditions
- ability to create copies of itself
- ability to perceive the world
- ability to perceive the self
- ability to reproduce sexually
- ability to communicate truths (danger, food, percepts)
- ability to lie
- ability to cooperate
- ability to cooperate at a large scale
- multicellular structure / compositionality ?
- ability to use tools
- ability to build (eg: architecture)

### Footnotes

[^1]: He's also the author of the book "Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned: The Myth of the Objective", where he explains a very interesting theory of innovation. In a nutshell, having goals kills creativity. 
[^2]: Reflect, for example, on how learning to drive a car, or any other physical task, was in the beginning. At first, your consciousness (and often your vision) is very focused on the detailed physical mechanics (of, say, turning the wheel, pressing the pedals, etc.) needed to perform tasks. After you gain some experience, your mind moves to high-level objectives and ignores the low-level (and now unconscious) mechcanics. For example, you may not think about how you are turning the wheel in the middle of a take-over manouver in a speedway.

## Light Tech Threat Model

## No matter your why, OPSEC is how
Be it for protection against a random loser unburying a mistake from the distant past to cancel you, the AI overlords predicting your every thought, senile nation states playing whac-a-mole, or some future threat we can't even begin to imagine today, some of us began increasing our awareness as to what information we make available online. Just in case.

OPSEC (short for operational security) is the practice of protecting critical information from unwanted observers. Unless you're in the military, it's synonymous with online privacy. Here are some simple and inexpensive ways I have found to improve online informational hygiene. I have no commercial affiliation with any of the following, it's just stuff I use and love. No referral links either! I'll roughly order them from basic to hardcore, so you can follow along until you're satisfied with your protection level.

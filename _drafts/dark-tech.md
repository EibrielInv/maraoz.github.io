The [Miranda warning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_warning) is already outdated. As Mat Travizano predicted more than a decade ago: "Not only your actual actions, but everything you'll probably say, you have the intention to do, or might possibly think... will be used against you". 

# Threat Model

As the West is importing Maoist China's [Struggle Sessions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struggle_session) (now known as cancel culture), you better conform to woke society expectations, or else... you're out! For a time I believed this was merely a US-only nonsense, but reality hit to close to home when some National Argentine Rugby team members [got cancelled for some racist tweets **from 10 years ago** after the internet mob got angry at their lack of "proper" homage to the recently defunct Maradona](https://alkhaleejtoday.co/sport/5483878/The-cancellation-of-Los-Pumas-Xenophobic-and-misogynistic-tweets-from-the-Argentine-rugby-team-revealed-after-the-disappointing-tribute-to-Maradona.html).

AI keeps exceeding our wildest expectations year after year. Each data point we produce and publish on the web can and will feed a machine learning algorithm which predicts your next action with ever greater accuracy. To show you better ads. To get you to stay just a little longer using this app. To change your mind about this topic. Predictive power is dominance, and we're (sometimes willingly) feeding the beast! 


# No matter the why, OPSEC is how
Be it for protection against someone unburying a mistake from the distant past, the AI overlords, or some future threat we can't even begin to imagine today, some of us have started increasing our awareness as to what information we make available online. 

OPSEC (short for operational security) is the practice of protecting critical information from unwanted observers. For most of us, it's synonymous with online privacy. Here are some simple and cheap ways I have found to improve online informational hygene. I have no commercial affiliation with any of the following, it's just stuff I use and love.


## ExpressVPN
Let's start with the basics. A VPN gives you basic encryption for all your connections (useful for unsecure networks like airports), but it also provides the 

## Cryptocurrency
Banks will sell or give away your financial information to advertisers, governments and other nefarious institutions you might not especially fancy. Coins such as [zcash](https://z.cash/), [Monero](https://www.getmonero.org/), and [Tornado for ETH/ERC20](https://tornado.cash/) provide pretty good privacy solutions for making payments and moving funds internationally. An interesting new project I've recently tried out is [Incognito](https://incognito.org/), which is a way to "wrap" pre-existing coins with a privacy mantle. It's sort of new and not very well audited, so be cautious and don't use it for big amounts of money.

## Privacy.com
In case you need to use fiat currencies (like most of us, for now), consider using Privacy.com - it lets you create as many virtual debit cards as you want for free. The main advantages are: (1) if one service provider get hacked, you don't need to call the bank for a new one, you just cancel that specific card, and (2) you can put in whichever plausible-looking billing address and purchases will work. Why on earth should Netflix, Spotify, et al. need to know my home address?? Unfortunately, last time I checked, a US bank account is required to use Privacy.com, so this is not for everyone. I've been using it for all my online purchases for more that 2 years now. If you happen to have a US bank account, [definitely check it out](https://privacy.com).

## DIY Email Masking
*We'll never send you spam, we promise!* Yeah, right. That's if you don't get hacked. And if your startup never gets acquired by a bigger and less scrupulous company. Inspired by Privacy.com, I setup a similar system but for email, for when I need to give it out (which is quite often, unfortunately). Now, each time I register to a new app, or I need to give my email IRL, I create a new one, instantly. Here's how:  

(1) Purchase a cheap domain at [Namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com/). Anything will do (eg: `niutqf4r1n.com`, `jljai01bpo.xyz`, `2348248024234.io` etc.) but I recommend something like `fruitsolutions.tech` for comedic purposes. If you're uninspired, use [domainwheel.com](https://domainwheel.com/). Some domains cost less than $2.   

(2) Go to your new domain's settings, and scroll down to the "REDIRECT EMAIL" section.  

(3) Add a new "catch-all" alias and forward it to your real email address.  


Done! Now, every time you need to provide an email, you can just invent a new one, like `facebook@fruitsolutions.tech`, or `landlord@fruitsolutions.tech` and all emails sent there will end up in your inbox. Now, if someone sends you spam, you can identify who did it (just remember who you gave that address to), and block it easily (by adding a filter to your inbox). Of course, you won't be able to *send* emails from all those addresses, but it's good to prevent every website and app from knowing your real email.  

(4) [optional] Repeat for various domains, to have even further control and compartimentalization.  

(5) [optional and mega hardcore] Create a new secret gmail account as the receiving end of the forwarding, and never give that address to anyone!   


## Avatars and pseudonyms: keep your name and face for meatspace
Stop showing your real face on the web. No, really, just stop. I know 2000s where all about using your real name on Facebook and taking our social lives online. That's over. By using your real name and pic, you allow associating your online activity with your physical body. Why would anyone want that? (the only exception I can think of is dating). I've sinned horribly on this multiple times. Here's a short guide (although following it is a long, gruelling process)

(1) search for your full name on google.  

(2) for each result that shows your real face, go to the page containing it, and contact the site owner asking nicely to remove your picture. You'll have to be creative in finding contact information. I've used contact forms, googled around to find site owner's email, twitter, or linkedin accounts, and edited some sites myself. If it gets to it, you may resort to legal action. In my case, most webadmins were very supportive and understanding.    

(3) repeat until there's no results showing your real face.  

(4) repeat with youtube, facebook, twitter, and any other site you think might have your image.  

(5) google 'avatar illustration', pick the one you like the most, and use it everywhere instead of your real face. If you want to get real fancy, comission an artist to do a custom avatar. In fact, I'll gift a profesionally illustrated avatar in any style of your chosing (or a domain name to mask emails) if you can find an image/video of my face online (please don't upload it yourself). Email me at [security@maraoz.com](mailto:security@maraoz.com) to redeem.   


# Final words

That's it! Hope you can implement at least one idea in the list. I'll be writing a complementary article next, called "Light Tech", in which I'll talk about techniques to minimize negative impact of tech to our peace of mind. If you'd like to read it, please subscribe below:

These are deep, complex albums and you should listen giving them your full attention. Otherwise, you'll just stay at the surface level, which is usually not where they shine. If you want something to listen while you work or hangout with friends, go with pop, lofi, or the countless "focus" and "chill" playlists. The following is music for music's sake. Give it the respect it deserves and you shall find each author's generousness.

## 1. "22, A Million" by Bon Iver

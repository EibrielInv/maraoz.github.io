title:  "Builder Mindset, Seeker Mindset"
draft: true

In the early days of creating [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/), I found myself constantly switching between programming and auditing, two very different activities. We had a very small team and each had to wear many hats, splitting our time between building the OpenZeppelin contracts library and auditing code for our clients. I was contantly surprised at how different it felt to do each activity (programming vs auditing). With time, I came to realize these moods or states of minds are more general and apply way beyond programming vs auditing. I call them "Builder Mindset" and "Seeker Mindset". This is, of course, a false dichotomy. However, I find it useful to think thse archetypes when working on something myself, or to analyze how other people approach tasks.

## Builder Mindset

Builders create things. They synthezise them. Builders are optimists. They create and make use of good assumptions. They create stories to coordinate teams under the flag of a grand vision. Builders expand on shared knowledge to create amazing new things. They value width over depth. Builders often get started as soon as possible and want to learn along the way. They abstract and generalize. They extrapolate and take risks.

Builders are heard saying:
- "When in doubt, do."
- "Fortune favors the bold."


## Seeker Mindset

Seekers tear things apart. They analyze them. Seekers are pessimists. They question all assumptions. They dive deep into details trying to arrive at corners of knowledge nobody else has found. Seekers are detail-oriented and meticulous. They often choose to reflect or sketch ideas in paper before moving on to implementing them. They organize and categorize. They find internal contradictions and minimize risks.

Seekers are heard saying:
- "实事求是。" (seek truth from facts)

# Summary and Final Words 

Programmers are builders. Auditors are seekers.
Entrepreneurs are builders. Scientists are seekers.
Actors are builders. Directors are seekers. (??)
...
Good leaders are usually both builders and seekers.

Builders are obsessed with doing. Seekers are obsessed with understanding.
Both builders and seekers are dopamine-driven.

Of course, none of us are 100% builders or 100% seekers.  
Moreover, these are by no means the only two paths in life.


 "To explain the world to ourselves we make up stories and then, because we are good storytellers, we get infatuated by them and confuse our representations of the world with the world itself. This confusion afflicts scientists as much as laypeople; indeed, it affects us more, because we have such powerful stories in our tool kits."

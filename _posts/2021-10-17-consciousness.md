<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness">Consciousness</a> is a very hard problem. It matters because it's a precondition to everything else: "what does love, science, art, meaning matter, if you're a zombie or in a coma?"([Searle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_OPQgPIdKg)) It's probably one of the most commonly misunderstood topics in science today. The prevailing view both in the scientific and tech community is that of materialism: consciousness [emerges from brain activity and it happens automatically](https://youtu.be/luGE5e2_xKM?t=1410). That's not surprising: the whole epistemological framework of science relies on leaving subjective interpretations out of its models. 
For many of us, this explanation is not enough: I find myself in the camp that is looking for a deeper understanding of what makes us conscious. That's why I'm convinced science needs to evolve to include subjective phenomena in its models. As Schrödinger wrote in his fantastic "What is Life" book: 
> I maintain that [consciousness] cannot be solved on the level of present-day science which is still entirely engulfed in the ‘exclusion principle’ – without knowing it – hence the antinomy. To realize this is valuable, but it does not solve the problem. You cannot remove the ‘exclusion principle’ by act of parliament as it were. Scientific attitude would have to be rebuilt, science must be made anew. Care is needed.

> The reason why our sentient, percipient and thinking ego is met nowhere within our scientific world picture can easily be indicated in seven words: because it is itself that world picture.

> “The strange fact that on the one hand all our knowledge about the world around us, both
that gained in everyday life and that revealed by the most carefully planned and painstaking laboratory experiments, rests entirely on immediate sense perception, while on the other hand this knowledge fails to reveal the relations of the sense perceptions to the outside world, so that in the picture or model we form of the outside world, guided by our scientific discoveries, all sensual qualities are absent”
> "Speaking without metaphor we have to declare that we are here faced with one of these typical antinomies caused by the fact that we have not yet succeeded in elaborating a fairly understandable outlook on the world without retiring our own mind, the producer of the world picture, from it, so that mind has no place in it. The attempt to press it into it, after all, necessarily produces some absurdities." (Erwin Schrödinger, „Mind and Matter: the Tarner Lectures", 1956)

This requires rethinking the way we conduct the scientific method, and redefining what constitutes a good theory of consciousness. Popper's falsification principle is not enough. I like David Deutsch's idea of looking for good explanations as the first step. Without the pretense of setting up a new epystemologycal program for a new science of consciousness, in this post, I'll try to define which phenomena need to be accounted for by a new comprehensive explanation of consciousness. In future posts (probably in a couple of years), I will explore ideas on how we can build such a theory.

## Focusing only on default human consciousness doesn't seem promising
In Thomas Khun's classic "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions", he explains how before a change in scientific paraidgm, there's a focus on anomalies. Anomalies are particularly hard to solve puzzles of nature where the outcomes predicted by theory stubbornly differ from observed data. Let us focus on the "anomalies of consciousness" in an effort to shed light on what might be missing in our current understanding. Default human consciousness is boring and unproductive. Let's explore questions that remain open at the fringe:

## Anomaly N: Sleep, Dreams and Somnambulism (sleep-walking)
Sleep such an interesting phenomena. One of the most striking effects of sleep is the vivid dreams we *all* experience. Some questions a new theory of consiousness must attack: why and how do we lose consciousness while we sleep? Why are we sometimes conscious while sleeping (ie: when we dream)? How do dreams work? How does sleep-waliking work? How can people that sleep-walk perform such complicated tasks like cooking, having conversations, cleaning the house, and even [DRIVING](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sleepless-in-america/200812/can-people-drive-while-asleep)? What exactly *can't* a sleep-walker do? what are their limits? Why do we sleep? Why do we ever wake up? Couldn't we just do everything we already do but without consciousness?

## Anomaly N: Psychedelics
Psychedelics are also known to produce powerful changes in consciousness. Although the mechanisms of these drugs are not entirely understood, many people report profound spiritual experiences after using them. What are the mechanisms of psychedelics? How exactly do they change the quality of our subjective experience? What mechanism causes specific hallucinations to appear? How do specific neurotransmiters and psychoactive compounds generate each effect?  A complete theory of conciouness must explain how consciousness is affected by these drugs.

## Anomaly N: Attention and Meditation
Meditation is an interesting phenomena that has been practiced for several millenia by millions of people around the world. It's also interesting because it's an anomaly. The goal of meditation is to improve concentration and to achieve a higher level of consciousness. It's not clear though how this is achieved, but many people who practiice meditation regularly report that it increases their consciousness of emotion, feelings, and thoughts.

> There is substantial evidence that we can only remember items from the sensory world that were attended (i.e., that were a focus of conscious awareness; Penfield, 1958). Although unattended items may be processed in some form to allow their characterization as uninteresting targets for attention, through what is known as pre-attentive processing (Neisser, 1967), such items do not reach the site of accessible memory. Only attended items can be recalled from memory. It therefore seems that consciousness may represent the gateway to memory. While not all items that reach consciousness may be remembered, it seems to be the case that all items that are remembered must have reached consciousness.
Although consciousness is thus a sine qua non for laying down the memory for an item, it is nevertheless not required for the memory per se. Indeed, the very concept of memory implies a lack of consciousness, for the act of remembering corresponds precisely to bringing the item back into consciousness from its latent storage status outside of consciousness. This lack consciousness is evident for the vast range of items in long-term memory, such as the name of your first-grade teacher (which you may not have brought to consciousness for decades), but is also true for short-term iconic memory. We have all had the experience of being told a phone number, then doing competing activity during which we are not conscious of the number, then being able to recall the phone number by directing attention to the internal auditory “echo” of that number that is still available for a few minutes, though outside the immediate consciousness until it is accessed.

## Anomaly N: Curiosity, Intelligence and Compression
> Consider the following thought experiment. You are a biochemist with the misfortune to have been born with a genetic defect that disables the blue receptors in your retinas. Consequently you have a form of colour blindness in which you are able to see only red and green, and mixtures of the two such as yellow, but anything purely blue also looks to you like one of those mixtures. Then you discover a cure that will cause your blue receptors to start working. Before administering the cure to yourself, you can confidently make certain predictions about what will happen if it works. One of them is that, when you hold up a blue card as a test, you will see a colour that you have never seen before. You can predict that you will call it ‘blue’, because you already know what the colour of the card is called (and can already check which colour it is with a spectrophotometer). You can also predict that when you first see a clear daytime sky after being cured you will experience a similar quale to that of seeing the blue card. But there is one thing that neither you nor anyone else could predict about the outcome of this experiment, and that is: what blue will look like. Qualia are currently neither describable nor predictable – a unique property that should make them deeply problematic to anyone with a scientific world view (though, in the event, it seems to be mainly philosophers who worry about it). I consider this exciting evidence that there is a fundamental discovery to be made which will integrate things like qualia into our other knowledge.

David Deutsch, "The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World"

## Anomaly N: Volition (free will) and the sense of self

## Anomaly N: Learning
> Any succession of events in which we take part with sensations, perceptions and possibly with actions gradually drops out of the domain of consciousness when the same string of events repeats itself in the same way very often. 

Schrödinger, "What is Life?"

Of crucial importance, in my opinion, is the relation between learning and conscousness. How does learning work? Why does learning seem to entail a gradual change in consciousness from an awareness of low-level mechanics to the sense of flow and quasi-identification with the task encountered in mastery? What is the relation between consciousness and memory? What are the mechanisms of memory?



I'll leave you with a longer excerpt from Schrödinger to think about:
> If you ask a physicist what is his idea of yellow light, he will tell you that it is transversal electro-magnetic waves of wave-length in the neighbourhood of 590 millimicrons. If you ask him: But where does yellow come in? he will say: In my picture not at all, but these kinds of vibrations, when they hit the retina of a healthy eye, give the person whose eye it is the sensation of yellow. On further inquiry you may hear that different wave-lengths produce different colour-sensations, but not all do so, only those between about 800 and 400 μμ. To the physicist the infra-red (more than 800 μμ) and the ultra-violet (less than 400 μμ) waves are much the same kind of phenomena as those in the region between 800 and 400 μμ, to which the eye is sensitive. How does this peculiar selection come about? It is obviously an adaptation to the sun’s radiation, which is strongest in this region of wave-lengths but falls off at either end. Moreover, the intrinsically brightest colour-sensation, the yellow, is encountered at that place (within the said region) where the sun’s radiation exhibits its maximum, a true peak. We may further ask: Is radiation in the neighbourhood of wave-length 590 μμ the only one to produce the sensation of yellow? The answer is: Not at all. If waves of 760 μμ, which by themselves produce the sensation of red, are mixed in a definite proportion with waves of 535 μμ, which by themselves produce the sensation of green, this mixture produces a yellow that is indistinguishable from the one produced by 590 μμ. Two adjacent fields illuminated, one by the mixture, the other by the single spectral light, look exactly alike, you cannot tell which is which. Could this be foretold from the wave-lengths – is there a numerical connection with these physical, objective characteristics of the waves? No. Of course, the chart of all mixtures of this kind has been plotted empirically; it is called the colour triangle. But it is not simply connected with the wave-lengths. There is no general rule that a mixture of two spectral lights matches one between them; for example a mixture of ‘red’ and ‘blue’ from the extremities of the spectrum gives ‘purple’, which is not produced by any single spectral light. Moreover, the said chart, the colour triangle, varies slightly from one person to the other, and differs considerably for some persons, called anomalous trichromates (who are not colour-blind). The sensation of colour cannot be accounted for by the physicist’s objective picture of light-waves.
> ...
> But the most striking fact about sound is that a mixture of several distinct frequencies never combines to produce just one intermediate pitch such as could be produced by one intermediate frequency. To a large extent the superposed pitches are perceived separately – though simultaneously – especially by highly musical persons. The admixture of many higher notes (‘overtones’) of various qualities and intensities results in what is called the timbre (German: Klangfarbe), by which we learn to distinguish a violin, a bugle, a church bell, piano … even from a single note that is sounded.
> I have gone into some detail here, in order to make you feel that neither the physicist’s description, nor that of the physiologist, contains any trait of the sensation of sound. Any description of this kind is bound to end with a sentence like: those nerve impulses are conducted to a certain portion of the brain, where they are registered as a sequence of sounds. We can follow the pressure changes in the air as they produce vibrations of the ear-drum, we can see how its motion is transferred by a chain of tiny bones to another membrane and eventually to parts of the membrane inside the cochlea, composed of fibres of varying length, described above. We may reach an understanding of how such a vibrating fibre sets up an electrical and chemical process of conduction in the nervous fibre with which it is in touch. We may follow this conduction to the cerebral cortex and we may even obtain some objective knowledge of some of the things that happen there. But nowhere shall we hit on this ‘registering as sound’, which simply is not contained in our scientific picture, but is only in the mind of the person whose ear and brain we are speaking of.

  Summary: I propose a checklist of milestones that need to be achieved in order to "solve" AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).

I always believed in the power of strong visions to guide huge project executions. That's why reading science fiction is so common among of those who build awesome tech. Then, dividing huge problems into smaller more addressable chunks is the way to progress towards those grand visions. 

I've been thinking and reading a lot about efforts in achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and believe it could help to provide a clear path of milestones that we need to achieve in order to reach the panacea of AGI. I'm starting the list, and I'll make it open-source to get others (you!) to update it and improve it collaboratively. 

Similar to what Aubrey de Grey’s list of the [7 causes of death](https://www.longlonglife.org/en/transhumanism-longevity/aging/aubrey-de-grey/transhumanism-aubrey-de-greys-causes-of-aging-with-sens-foundation/) did for longevity studies, or what the [Millennium Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems) did for mathematics, maybe we can build a program that motivates young researchers to tackle AGI one jump at a time.


## Principles of Design
The principles I've chosen to create, maintain and order the list are: 
- Simple: the list should not be exhaustive, but provide inpirational guidelines.
- Engineering mindset: the list should focus on specific capabilities and not research or implementation details.
- Progressive value: milestones should be listed in ascending order of value added to society.

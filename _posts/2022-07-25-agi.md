I always believed in the power of strong visions to guide huge project executions. That's why reading science fiction is so common among of those who build awesome tech.  
I've been thinking and reading a lot about efforts 
For Artificial Intelligence to reach General Intelligence, all of these milestones must be achieved:

✅ AI beats humans at chess — 1997 [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov">done</a> thanks to IBM]<br />
✅ AI beats humans at go — 2016 [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol">done</a> thanks to DeepMind]<br />
✅ AI wins Jeopardy game — 2011 [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Watson#Jeopardy!">done</a> thanks to IBM]<br />
✅ AI beats humans at [StarCraft](https://starcraft2.com/en-us/). [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaStar_(software)">done</a> thanks to DeepMind]<br />
✅ Some AI generated painting or visual artwork sells for more than $100k — 2021 [<a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x66579f35ed2c335a218604bd1c0a1aaa938024f5a3c6d87884e4c01b3a90a0d4">done</a> thanks to Chromie Squiggle #9 by Snowfro and probaby many other procedurally generated NFTs] <br />
⬜ A robot can cut a human's hair.
⬜ AI beats humans at non-simulated car race (NASCAR, F1, etc).<br />
⬜ AI beats humans at [flying drone race](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/08/the-new-underground-sport-of-first-person-drone-racing/). <br />
⬜ AI beats humans at [golf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CVURQdFILk). <br />
⬜ AI beats humans at tennis. <br />
⬜ People have ongoing relationships with [chat bots](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/science/for-sympathetic-ear-more-chinese-turn-to-smartphone-program.html) for entertainment. <br />
⬜ Some AI is a profitable autonomus economic agent. (e.g. there's a web service, API or site that is running for 1 year without any human aid and is making a profit.) <br />
⬜ Some AI generated music "band" has more than 1 million monthly listeners on Spotify or equivalent platform. <br />

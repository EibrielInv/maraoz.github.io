For Artificial Intelligence to reach General Intelligence, all of these milestones must be achieved:

✅ A.I. beats humans at chess.
✅ A.I. beats humans at go.
✅ A.I. beats humans at [StarCraft](https://starcraft2.com/en-us/). [<a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii">done</a> thanks to DeepMind]<br />
✅ Some A.I. generated painting or visual artwork sells for more than $100k at 2016 value.

In the long run, the most important question for humanity is whether we will be able to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)
[A 2020 survey](https://gcrinstitute.org/papers/055_agi-2020.pdf) identified 72 active AGI research projects spread across 37 countries. This is hardly enough people. In this post I'll explain why attempting AGI is the highest leverage bet and the most important project we can attempt as a species.

## What is AGI? (skip if you already know the acronym)

AGI stands for artificial general intelligence. But what does the "General" in AGI mean? Folks have different answers. An AI that can do anything a human can do. An AI that can solve any problem given to them. An AI that can surpass human intelligence. 

I prefer this definition: a computer system that can perform *any* task that a human can, given roughly the same time to do it. This includes studying if it needs to. This includes physical tasks too. If you can reasonably ask some human to do it, then an AGI should also be able to do it.

## Why should this matter? 

### 1. Narrow AI is not enough
The most common reaction to excitement with AGI is related to the current or potential advances narrow AIs (application-specific artificial intelligence, eg: chess, translation, image classification, medical diagnosis) have brought us.  

I am not denying that narrow AI is amazing, and will continue to be. We can already see the benefits it's bringing us in so many aspects of our lives. But AGI is orders of magnitude more important.  

Narrow AI is not scalable. It can only do the specific tasks it was designed for. This is fine for certain applications. But if we want AI to help us with the really hard problems we face, we need AI that is more flexible. This is the power of generalization and universality.  

AGI is the ultimate tool. Imagine you had a tool that could do *anything*. That's what AGI would be.  


### 2. Nation states will control AGI if we don't  
The second reason is that nation states will create AGI if we don't. They will then be in a position to completely control access to the technology. They have the resources and the motivation to do so. We saw this happen with nuclear weapons.  

For example, let's say a big nation state like China or the US has built AGI capability. Imagine the colossally unfair advantage they would have in matters of strategic analysis and surveillance. They could have thousands of "people" thinking about a problem 24/7, making research, and trying out different solutions. They could train bot agents with different skillsets and knowledge, that can work together to defeat any adversary. These "people" never get tired, never take vacation, never get sick, and never quit. They could use AGI to design and manufacture next-generation robotics to autonomously navigate urban environments in real time. They could send these robots to gather ground intelligence anywhere in the world.  
Once a state achieves AGI, they will completely dominate and control all other states and individuals easily. AGI would give them unprecedented power.   

These are just a few examples of the kinds of gargantuan advantages that would be possible with AGI. The point is, whoever controls AGI will have a huge advantage over everyone else.  

### 3. Building a brighter future
AGI will be the most powerful force in the history of humanity. It will shape our future in ways that we cannot even begin to imagine. The birth of the first AGI will be a technological singularity of such magnitude, that the world order will change. 
In other words, AGI will be like a God.  
In other words, AGI will be like a Nation State.  

AGI will help us solve problems that are currently intractable. Problems like climate change, energy and food production, disease, and poverty. Capitalism, democracy, and nation states brought us only this far. The challenges we face today are transnational and [only an out-of-system agent can coordinate humanity in solving them](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/).

[A 2020 survey](https://gcrinstitute.org/papers/055_agi-2020.pdf) identified 72 active AGI research projects spread across 37 countries. This is hardly enough people for the most important project for humanity. In this post I'll explain why attempting AGI is the highest leverage bet we can make as a species.

## What is AGI? (skip if you already know the acronym)

AGI stands for artificial general intelligence. But what does the "General" in AGI mean? Folks have different answers. An AI that can do anything a human can do. An AI that can solve any problem given to them. An AI that can surpass human intelligence. 

I prefer this definition: a computer system that can perform *any* task that a human can, given similar amounts of time. This includes studying if it needs to. This includes physical tasks too. If you can reasonably ask some human to do it, then an AGI should also be able to do it.

## Why should this matter? 
The most common reaction to excitement with the potential of creating AGI is related to the actual or potential advances narrow AI (application-specific artificial intelligence, eg: chess, translation, image classification, medical diagnosis).

I am not denying that narrow AI is amazing, and will continue to be. We can already see the benefits it's bringing us in so many aspects of our lives. But I believe that AGI is orders of magnitude more important.  


With narrow AI we can make great advances in specific tasks. But with AGI we would be able to do anything that can be done with technology. This is because once we have AGI, no task is beyond reach. This is the power of generalization and universality. 
 
The birth of the first AGI would be a technological singularity of such magnitude, that the world order would change. AGI will help us to solve problems that are currently intractable. Problems like climate change, energy and food production, disease, and poverty. Capitalism and nation states brought us to this huge mess and it won't be able to save us from it. [Only an out-of-system agent can coordinate our efforts](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/). AGI could bring about a new world order that enables us to side-step the global problems we currently face.  

## Post-AGI Thought Experiment
Imagine an individual or organizations builds an AGI. They can suddenly spawn virtual humans at will. For example, let's say a big nation state like China or the US has built the capability. Imagine the colossally unfair advantage they would have in matters of strategic analysis. They could have thousands or millions of "people" thinking about a problem 24/7, making research, and trying out different solutions. They could train "people" with different skillsets and knowledge, working together on a problem. They could use AGI to design and manufacture next-generation robotics to autonomously navigate urban environments in real time. They could send these robots to gather ground intelligence anywhere in the world. Once a state achieves AGI, they will completely dominate all others easily.  

Now imagine a different scenario: an individual ([eg: John Carmack](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/19/john-carmack-agi-keen-raises-20-million-from-sequoia-nat-friedman-and-others/)) or a corporation that has built this capability. They could have virtual AGI assistants for the cost of running computing instances. These "people" never get tired, never take vacation, never get sick, and never quit. They are also very good at their jobs. The competitive advantages would be insurmountable. They would easily become the richest and most powerful organization or person in the world.

These are just a few examples of the kinds of gargantuan advantages that would be possible with AGI. The point is, whoever controls AGI will have a huge advantage over everyone else.

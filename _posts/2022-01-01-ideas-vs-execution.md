"Ideas are cheap, execution is everything" is a common adage in the startup community. It means roughly: anyone can have good ideas, but unless you actually put in the work, they are worthless. You need to sit your ass, work hard on your idea, pivot many times, until something works. And that will probably be something completely different to your original idea. I've preached this many times, both internally in my own teams, and to friends looking to start new projects.

However, I recently revised my position. I think chosing a good idea is crucial to build a successful startup. And I don't mean this in a romantic sense, but in a very practical one.
I don't think it's good advice for people starting a company to start executing on some random idea just because "execution is everything".

## Ideas do have value
Let's first define 'idea'. In this context, a startup idea is a rough plan or vision of what you want to build and why that's cool. It's a hypothesis about a problem that people have, and how you can solve it. It's a story you tell yourself and others, to explain what you're doing and why.

The problem I have with "ideas are cheap, execution is everything" is that there's a hidden relation between good execution and good ideas, because:
- It's much harder to execute on bad idea than on a good idea, because they are less defined, clear, and exciting.  
- It's easier to lose motivation if your idea is bad. It's easier to work on a great idea for years.
- It's easier to sell a good idea to potential partners/cofounders.
- It's *very* hard to hire people if your idea sucks.
- It's hard to raise capital if your idea is bad.

In other words, a good idea is actually a prerequisite for executing well.

## What defines a good idea?
So, what is ✨**a *good* idea**✨?  
A good idea is one that scratches your own itch. It's often a question that appears in your mind when you're deep into exploring some obscure knowledge. It's not a remix of what everyone's talking about, or related the hot topic in your industry, or something that makes you get attention at a party. Good startup ideas are not well understood by most other people. 

I also like this suggestion by David Lynch: 
> Ideas are like fish. If you want to catch little fish, you can stay in the shallow water. But if you want to catch the big fish, you’ve got to go deeper. Down deep, the fish are more powerful and more pure. They’re huge and abstract. And they’re very beautiful.

My interpretation is: surround yourself with interesting people. Dive deep into weird topics that interest you. Follow your curiosity. Be okay with being misunderstood. That's where good ideas come from.

  Summary: I share my vision for Decentraland's next 5 years.

As some of you may know, I've been involved in the early days of [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/). I participated in creating the first prototypes between 2015 and 2017. Back then, Decentraland's testnet ran as [a fork of bitcoin](https://github.com/decentraland/bronzeage-node/commit/7a5245e8434558d298d07d0dd2bd9862ca3af408), and fully in the browser. Crazy times. I also contributed in naming the project and defining the vision: to build a decentralized and open virtual reality world. I took little part in actually executing on that vision: the credit there goes to [Esteban](https://twitter.com/eordano), [Ari](https://twitter.com/arimeilich), and the amazing Decentraland team. 

Today, almost 7 years later, I believe we can say that original vision from 2015 was achieved. Decentraland today truly is open, decentralized, and it's an increasingly amazing shared 3d virtual world. 

After leaving the project to focus on OpenZeppelin back in 2017, I've been amazed by evolution. In the past years, I've rejoined the Decentraland community, participating in [its DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/), building some [content](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=52,90) and [tools](https://genesis.city/). I was ecstatic to realize the original vision was achieved. 

I also realized that my best contribution to the project was probably not going to be related to execution (funding or building projects, voting in the DAO, creating content), but to strategy and vision (as I contributed in the beginning). I hope the sheer amount of years I spent thinking about Decentraland give me some authority, or at least an audience. The following are my personal views (again, I'm not part of the Decentraland Foundation). I'll be candid and straightforward, tackling the platform's main problems head on. Some ideas are mine. Some ideas are spoken in hushed tones among Decentraland community members, afraid to risk proposing crazy stuff. I hope that sharing my vision sparks strategic discussions and inspires our community to take Decentraland to the next level.

## The Open Metaverse

So, how does Decentraland look like in 2027, five years from now? To me, it has become **the open metaverse**. The free (as in "free speech", not "free beer"), community-owned alternative to [whatever companies such as Meta](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZCPTTkVk9ojNqiD2zKsuy-ov0Bc=/0x0:2045x1363/1200x800/filters:focal(0x0:2045x1363)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/48903959/zuck.0.0.jpg) create. I always thought of Decentraland as a VR-browser. Today, most people use Google Chrome, Safari, or Edge to browse the web. However, open source and free alternatives such as Firefox and Brave are there, for those of us who value freedom, tech sovereignty, and open standards. 

How can Decentraland become the de-facto standard for an open metaverse? I think we need to improve the following three things, in order of importance:
1) Accessibility
2) Developer-friendliness
3) Cozyness

## How we improve Decentraland's Accessibility
- private lands
- public land accessibility
- continuous land issuance
- genesis city -> first city of many?

## How we improve Decentraland's Developer-friendliness
- ecosystem development fund
- fully document components and APIs
- build more official tutorials
	- how to run a node
	- how to build dynamic scene content

Decentraland as platform is way more powerful than most users know. 

## How we improve Decentraland's Cozyness
- 14 y/o house building
- social interactions
- adventures and things to do globally, not NFT 1-time events

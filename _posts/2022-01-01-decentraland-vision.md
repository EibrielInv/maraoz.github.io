  Summary: I share my vision for Decentraland's next 5 years.

As some of you may know, I've been involved in the early days of [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/). I participated in creating the first prototypes between 2015 and 2017. Back then, Decentraland's testnet ran as [a fork of bitcoin](https://github.com/decentraland/bronzeage-node/commit/7a5245e8434558d298d07d0dd2bd9862ca3af408), and fully in the browser. Crazy times. I also contributed in naming the project and defining the vision: to build a decentralized and open virtual reality world. I took little part in actually executing on that vision: the credit there goes to [Esteban](https://twitter.com/eordano), [Ari](https://twitter.com/arimeilich), and the amazing Decentraland team. 

Today, almost 7 years later, I believe we can say that original vision from 2015 was achieved. Neal Stephenson should be [proud of us](https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1430920344p8/545.jpg) (?). Decentraland today truly is open, decentralized, and it's an increasingly amazing shared 3d virtual world. 

After leaving the project to focus on OpenZeppelin back in 2017, I've been amazed by evolution. In the past years, I've rejoined the Decentraland community, participating in [its DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/), building some [content](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=52,90) and [tools](https://genesis.city/). I was ecstatic to realize the original vision was achieved. 

I also realized that my best contribution to the project was probably not going to be related to execution (funding or building projects, voting in the DAO, creating content), but to strategy and vision (as I contributed in the beginning). I hope the sheer amount of years I spent thinking about Decentraland give me some authority, or at least an audience. The following are my personal views (again, I'm not part of the Decentraland Foundation). I'll be candid and straightforward, tackling the platform's main problems head on. Some ideas are mine. Some ideas are spoken in hushed tones among Decentraland community members, afraid to risk proposing crazy stuff. I hope that sharing my vision sparks strategic discussions and inspires our community to take Decentraland to the next level.

## The Open Metaverse

So, how does Decentraland look like in 2027, five years from now? To me, it has become **the open metaverse**. The free (as in "free speech", not "free beer"), community-owned alternative to [whatever companies such as Meta create](https://maraoz.com/img/decentraland-vision/you-zuck.jpg). I always thought of Decentraland as a VR-browser. Today, most people use Google Chrome, Safari, or Edge to browse the web. However, open source and free alternatives such as Firefox and Brave are there, for those of us who value freedom, tech sovereignty, and open standards. 

How can Decentraland become the de-facto standard for an open metaverse? I think we need to improve the following three things, in order of importance:  

1) Accessibility  
2) Developer-friendliness  
3) Cozyness  

## How we improve Decentraland's Accessibility
Decentraland is currently too hard and/or expensive to use. If we're going to beat other metaverses, we need to make it very simple to get started. I imagine a 12-year-old kid building their house in Decentraland and inviting their friends to see what they built. Later, they dress up their avatars and go exploring the public lands. If they can't do that in Decentraland easily and for free, they will build it in Facebookverse and get ads everywhere (yuck). How can we make this happen?
### Private Lands
First, we need to enable private lands. This means the ability to create a 3d scene and share it only with whomever we want. I envison something very similar to today's [builder](https://builder.decentraland.org/), but with the ability to generate a shareable link to inhabit the scene with friends. This will allow people to get started in Decentraland for free, and it's step 1 in making it (economically) accessible. Having to buy a LAND for $7k USD or more to start creating playable content for Decentraland makes no sense. 
### More Public Lands
Aside from enabling private lands and content, we need to increase the pool of public lands. The original map of 301x301 parcels was great to bootstrap the project, but it's already too small for our community. What's worse, many LANDs are in the hands of speculators who will never deploy content to the world. My proposed solution? Continuous LAND issuance. Every day, or every week, the protocol can auction a new LAND, and the highest bidder can spawn a new LAND at any coordinate adjacent to an already existing one. Believe it or not, this was the original scheme for LAND issuance, and how the first testnet worked. Yes, this would reduce prices for already existing LANDs, but... if only whales can buy LANDs, other metaverses will kill Decentraland and your LAND will be worthless. Let's make Genesis City the first of many cities in Decentraland!

## How we improve Decentraland's Developer-friendliness
- ecosystem development fund
- fully document components and APIs
- build more official tutorials
	- how to run a node
	- how to build dynamic scene content

Decentraland as platform is way more powerful than most users know. 

## How we improve Decentraland's Cozyness
- 14 y/o house building
- social interactions
- adventures and things to do globally, not NFT 1-time events

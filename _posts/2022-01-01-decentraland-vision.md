As some of you may know, I've been involved in the early days of [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/). I participated in creating the first prototypes between 2015 and 2017. Back then, Decentraland's testnet ran as [a fork of bitcoin](https://github.com/decentraland/bronzeage-node/commit/7a5245e8434558d298d07d0dd2bd9862ca3af408), and fully in the browser. Crazy times. I also contributed in naming the project and defining the vision: to build a decentralized and open virtual reality world. I took little part in actually executing on that vision: the credit there goes to Esteban, Ari, and the amazing Decentraland team. 

Today, almost 7 years later, I believe we can say that original vision from 2015 was achieved. 

After leaving the project to focus on OpenZeppelin back in 2017, I've been amazed by its growth and progress. In the past years, I've rejoined the Decentraland community, participating in [its DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/), building some [content](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=52,90) and [tools](https://genesis.city/). I was ecstatic to realize the original vision was achieved. Decentraland today truly is open, decentralized, and it's an increasingly amazing shared 3d virtual world. 

I also noticed that my contribution to the project was probably not going to be related to execution. I have many ideas on what can be built in Decentraland, and where it should go as a platform. However, I'm no longer part of the team, and don't have enough context to help determine the short term tactics. So, I decided to share my personal vision for the project for the next 5 years. The following are my personal views (again, I'm not part of the Decentraland Foundation). I'll be candid and straightforward. I hope that sharing my vision sparks strategic discussions and inspires our community to take Decentraland to the next level.

## The Open Metaverse

So, how does Decentraland look like in 2027, five years from now? To me, it has become the open metaverse. The free (as in "free speech", not "free beer"), community-owned alternative to whatever companies such as Meta create. I always thought of Decentraland as a VR-browser. Today, most people use Google Chrome, Safari, or Edge to browse the web. However, open source and free alternatives such as Firefox and Brave are there, for those of us who value freedom and open standards. 

How can Decentraland become the de-facto standard for an open metaverse? I think we need to improve the following three things, in order of importance:
1) Accessibility
2) Developer-friendliness
3) Cozyness

## How we improve Decentraland's Accessibility
- private lands
- public land accessibility
- continuous land issuance
- genesis city -> first city of many?

## How we improve Decentraland's Developer-friendliness
- ecosystem development fund
- fully document components and APIs
- build more official tutorials
	- how to run a node
	- how to build dynamic scene content

Decentraland as platform is way more powerful than most users know. 

## How we improve Decentraland's Cozyness
- 14 y/o house building
- social interactions
- adventures and things to do globally, not NFT 1-time events

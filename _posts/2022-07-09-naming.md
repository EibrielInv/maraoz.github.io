Naming might be the most underrated skill.
Finding good names for things is the hidden art of master communicators. 

A good name is memorable, inspires, and aligns people around it. A bad name leads to confusion, subtle misalignments, and wasted efforts. 

The better you are at naming, the better you'll be at programming, sales, and management.
But, what makes a good name? I'll try to get down to mechanics, and not talk about high-level design goals like the above mentioned (memorable, inspiring, etc.) 

1. **Intertwined**  
A good name is strongly interconnected to many aspects of the meaning it represents. It evokes the right images in people's minds. For example, if you're naming a fun, dorky and cute mascot, you want your name to be fun, dorky and cute too. "Boop", "Ziggy", and "Nyan" are much better names than "Bob", "Tiara", or "XD1234_lol".  

2. **Aesthetic**  
Aside from efficiently guiding minds to the right concepts, great names are not obvious. They have a "personality", or an aesthetic. It is influenced by one or more principles external to its meaning. Some examples: alliteration (Krispy Kreme), assonance (Coca Cola), free-form association (Google), how the words look visually (counterexample: Dribbble), and humor (Yahoo!). You should think of something quite orthogonal to the meaning, and add it as a spice to the name.  

3. **Simple**  
Good names are short and easy to pronounce. Long names are just hard to forget and process for first-time readers. Hard to pronounce words require people to do great efforts or be native speakers of a language to work.  


## Examples

### Horrible names
❌Intertwined ❌Aesthetic ❌Simple  
Ethereum, Spotify, SUV, OS X, CSS, HTML, XML, JSON, Jupyter  

### Bad names
Obvious names that have good meaning ties but not much else  
✔️Intertwined ❌Aesthetic ❌Simple  
COVID-19, Decentraland, Whatsapp, blockchain, JavaScript, Microsoft, Bang & Olufsen  

Sexy but otherwise dumb or overcomplicated  
❌Intertwined ✔️Aesthetic ❌Simple  
Airbnb, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Tumblr, Xbox  

Unrelated and dull but at least easy.  
❌Intertwined ❌Aesthetic ✔️Simple  
Zoom, git, React, npm, Bing  

## Good names
Lacking strong connection to meaning but otherwise good.  
❌Intertwined ✔️Aesthetic ✔️Simple  
McDonald's, Apple, Google, Java, Python, Linux, Amazon, Kodak, Firefox, Hardhat  

Lacking personality but good  
✔️Intertwined ❌Aesthetic ✔️Simple  
Bitcoin, email, Meta, LEGO, Snapchat, Gmail, Tinder, maraoz, Rewilder  

Good but too complex  
✔️Intertwined ✔️Aesthetic ❌Simple  
OpenZeppelin, cryptocurrency, Stack Overflow  
  
## Great namess
✔️Intertwined ✔️Aesthetic ✔️Simple  
iPhone, Brunch, WIRED, emoji, GitHub, Docker, SpaceX, Tesla Motors, selfie, Burger King, Safari, DALL·E, Nike, Coca-Cola, Wikipedia, Reddit, Muun Wallet  

# Summary and Final Words 
Good names should be: (1) robustly intertwined with meaning (2) aesthetically interesting (3) accessible to understand and use.

As with most design decisions, it's often more important not to fuck up than to be perfect. So, in negative form, the tips would be:
(1) don't make your name meaningless
(2) don't make your name obvious and dull
(3) don't make your name too long or otherwise complex

Naming might be the most underrated skill.
Finding good names for things is the hidden art of master communicators. 

A good name is memorable, inspires, and aligns people around it. A bad name leads to confusion, subtle misalignments, and wasted efforts. 

The better you are at naming, the better you'll be at programming, sales, and management.
But, what makes a good name? I'll try to get down to mechanics, and not talk about high-level design goals like the above mentioned (memorable, inspiring, etc.) 

1. Intertwined with Meaning
A good name is strongly interconnected to many aspects of the meaning it represents. It evokes the right images in people's minds. For example, if you're naming a fun, dorky and cute mascot, you want your name to be fun, dorky and cute too. "Boop", "Ziggy", and "Nyan" are much better names than "Bob", "Tiara", or "XD1234_lol". Some avenues to consider are: cultural references (In Greek mythology, Nike is the Winged Goddess of Victory), etymology and language ties (the name "Siri" was chosen because it means "secret" in Swahili), sound symbolism (Bang & Olufsen is a company that designs audio products), and historical context (the name "Tesla" in honor to electrical genius Nikola Tesla).

2. Aesthetic
Aside from efficiently guiding minds to the right concepts, great names are not obvious. They have a "personality", or an aesthetic. It is influenced by one or more principles external to its meaning. Some examples: alliteration (Krispy Kreme), assonance (Coca Cola), free-form association (Google), and humor (Yahoo!). You should think of something completely orthogonal to the meaning, and add it as a spice to the name.

3. Short
Good names are short. Long names are just hard to forget and process for first-time readers.

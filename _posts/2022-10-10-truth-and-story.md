I tried so damn hard, to write a real blog post<br />
on this theme and failed far too many times.<br />
This is my attempt to hint at the topic<br />
without being explicit. I hope you enjoy it.<br />
<br />
For all of my life I’ve been searching for truth. <br />
And later with years I had learnt to build stories.<br />
Stories to empower, inspire, connect, and explain.<br />
Truth to accept, predict, transcend, and control.<br />
<br />
This, after a while, got a little confusing.<br />
It’s just so damn hard to distinguish the two.<br />
Say, what is the truth but yet another story?<br />
And, what is story but a well hidden truth?<br />
<br />
So I wrote on a paper, and kept it at hand.<br />
The ways I had found to dig truth and make stories:<br />
<br />
I seek to reject senseless tradition,<br />
in light of new evidence, brought by experiment.<br />
I vow to accept that down in their roots<br />
tradition holds nuggets of deep ancient truth.<br />
<br />
I praise the symbolic, with prismatic power.<br />
I touch the concrete, and can learn from its texture.<br />
In thought I can gather the most precious silver.<br />
In actions I muster secrets of experience.<br />
<br />
That science holds power to build explanations<br />
But can never tell how it is that we see color.<br />
Through all of these paths I could found new religions.<br />
From mind and emotion I smell what the path is.<br />
<br />
I see that in myth we can tackle the endless,<br />
And endlessly blind we can follow the rabbit.<br />
In elegance finding the magic of simple.<br />
In practical matters the roughness of fractal. <br />
<br />
And what is it then that we seek to discover?<br />
The genius, the explorer, the mystic, the lover.<br />
In knowing that truth hurts, why do we keep searching, <br />
and stories we die for keep weaving in mindspace?<br />
<br />
Here’s to the great storytellers.<br />
For they can fill their peer’s hearts.<br />
<br />
Here’s to the true truth seekers. <br />
They know what it means to be truly alone.<br />
<br />

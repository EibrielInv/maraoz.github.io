I've long wanted to start a tradition of sharing the best books I read each year. This year I read a lot, so I have lots to share. End of year also seems like a good time to promote good reading. Here's a list of the best books I read in 2021 with a very short review of why I liked them. 

**Request**: if you read this post, [please send me an email with 1 book you really enjoyed](mailto:books@maraoz.com). Some of the best books I ever read were recommended by random strangers on the internet. 

### 1. "What Is Life?" by Erwin Schrödinger
<img class="book" src="/img/books-2021/1.jpg">
[goodreads link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/162780.What_Is_Life_with_Mind_and_Matter_and_Autobiographical_Sketches)
<span class="badge badge-warning">non-fiction</span> <span class="badge badge-info">biology</span>
> “We are thus faced with the following question: Why should an organ like our brain, with the sensorial system attached to it, of necessity consist of an enormous number of atoms, in order that its physically changing state should be in close and intimate correspondence with a highly developed thought?”

Easily the best book(s) I read in 2021. The linked edition combines two related works by Schrödinger where the Nobel prize in physics delves into biology and consciousness science. Absolute must-read for anyone at least mildly interested in figuring out what we are (along the lines of [Darwin's The Origin of Species](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22463.The_Origin_of_Species) and [Dawkins's The Selfish Gene](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61535.The_Selfish_Gene)). An extremely honest, humble, inquisitive and nuanced exploration into the nature of life (both in the material and mental realm).


### 2. "Cryptonomicon" by Neal Stephenson 
<img class="book" src="/img/books-2021/2.jpg">
[goodreads link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38897904-cryptonomicon)
<span class="badge badge-success">fiction</span> <span class="badge badge-info">cypherpunk</span> <span class="badge badge-info">crypto</span>
> “Show some fucking adaptability!”

What an epic book. Must-read for people interested in cryptocurrencies. Already a fan of Stephenson since I read [Snow Crash](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40651883-snow-crash) (which inspired Decentraland), I found Cryptonomicon even better. The story is unbelievably prescient and thrilling, and combines mystery, action, and lots of humor. Split between two timelines, this books shows the power of crypto both during WW2 and an imagined future that hits way too close to reality. Probably the best depiction/parody of startup life I read, too.   


### 3. "The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect" by Roger Williams
<img class="book" src="/img/books-2021/3.jpg">
[goodreads link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38897904-cryptonomicon)
<span class="badge badge-success">fiction</span> <span class="badge badge-info">singularity</span> <span class="badge badge-info">ai</span>
> “Sometimes the truth is stupid.”  

A surprising find, this short book is perfect for sci-fi fans. Explores what happens after the singularity when AI exceeds human intelligence. I think I read this thanks to a mention from [George Hotz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hotz) in some interview. Recommended for anyone working on tech. 

### 4. "The Beginning of Infinity" by David Deutsch
<img class="book" src="/img/books-2021/4.jpg">
[goodreads link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12187787-the-beginning-of-infinity)
<span class="badge badge-warning">non-fiction</span> <span class="badge badge-info">epistemology</span> <span class="badge badge-info">science</span>
> “That is what makes good explanations essential to science: it is only when a theory is a good explanation – hard to vary – that it even matters whether it is testable. Bad explanations are equally useless whether they are testable or not. Most accounts of the differences between myth and science make too much of the issue of testability.”  


### 5. "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!" by Richard P. Feynman
<img class="book" src="/img/books-2021/5.jpg">
[goodreads link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9803995-surely-you-re-joking-mr-feynman-adventures-of-a-curious-character)
<span class="badge badge-warning">non-fiction</span> <span class="badge badge-info">science</span> <span class="badge badge-info">biography</span>
> “I often liked to play tricks on people when I was at MIT.”  

Some books are just fantastic ways to get a feel of how people lived in the 20th century. Some books teach you some great science. Some books give you a glimpse into an astounding mind with near-infinite curiosity. This books is all of that combined. At first I was hesitant to read this amazing autobiography based on the self-centered and pedantic title, but boy was I wrong! Feynman is indeed pedantic and self-centered, but the book is a gem. Thanks to [Esteban](https://twitter.com/eordano) who recommended this fantastic book. 


### 6. "Fahrenheit 451" by Ray Bradbury
<img class="book" src="/img/books-2021/6.jpg">
[goodreads link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13079982-fahrenheit-451)
<span class="badge badge-warning">fiction</span> <span class="badge badge-info">dystopia</span> <span class="badge badge-info">classic</span>
> ““Are you happy?” she said. “Am I what?” he cried.”  

> “Do you know why books such as this are so important? Because they have quality. And what does the word quality mean? To me it means texture. This book has pores. It has features. This book can go under the microscope. You’d find life under the glass, streaming past in infinite profusion. The more pores, the more truthfully recorded details of life per square inch you can get on a sheet of paper, the more ‘literary’ you are. That’s my definition, anyway. Telling detail. Fresh detail. The good writers touch life often.”  

A classic which almost needs no introduction: I just happened to read it this year. I was pleasantly surprised and a little saddened by the applicability of its critique of modern-day superficiality and general distractedness.


### 7. "The Trial" by Franz Kafka
<img class="book" src="/img/books-2021/7.jpg">
[goodreads link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18745889-the-trial)
<span class="badge badge-warning">fiction</span> <span class="badge badge-info">dystopia</span> <span class="badge badge-info">classic</span>
> “Progress had always been made, but the nature of this progress could never be specified.”   


Dreadful tale of a man slowly drowning in the bureaucratic nightmare of an incomprehensible process. Reading this will make you sad. Thanks EK for reccommending. 

### 8. "Entangled Life" by Merlin Sheldrake
<img class="book" src="/img/books-2021/8.jpg">
[goodreads link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50174716-entangled-life)
<span class="badge badge-warning">non-fiction</span> <span class="badge badge-info">biology</span>
> “We are not a special case. Even bacteria have viruses within them (a nanobiome?). Even viruses can contain smaller viruses (a picobiome?). Symbiosis is a ubiquitous feature of life.”     

Although at times a little too pop, this popular science book is fantastic. Before reading it, I thought of nature as geography + plants + animals, and I realized I was missing one of the most fascinating kingdoms: fungi. Very well written and you'll learn a lot.

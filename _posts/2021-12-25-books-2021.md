I've long wanted to start a tradition of sharing the best books I read each year. This year I read a lot, so I have lots to share. End of year also seems like a good time to promote good reading. Here's a list of the best books I read in 2021 with a very short review of why I liked them. 

**Request**: if you read this post, [please send me an email with 1 book you really enjoyed](mailto:books@maraoz.com). Some of the best books I ever read were recommended by random strangers on the internet. 

### "What Is Life?" by Erwin Schrödinger
<img class="book" src="/img/books-2021/1.jpg">
[goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/162780.What_Is_Life_with_Mind_and_Matter_and_Autobiographical_Sketches)
<span class="badge badge-info">non-fiction</span> <span class="badge badge-info">biology</span>
> “We are thus faced with the following question: Why should an organ like our brain, with the sensorial system attached to it, of necessity consist of an enormous number of atoms, in order that its physically changing state should be in close and intimate correspondence with a highly developed thought?”

Easily the best book(s) I read in 2021. The linked edition combines two related works by Schrödinger where the Nobel prize in physics delves into biology and consciousness science. Absolute must-read for anyone at least mildly interested in figuring out what we are (along the lines of [Darwin's The Origin of Species](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22463.The_Origin_of_Species) and [Dawkins's The Selfish Gene](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61535.The_Selfish_Gene)). An extremely honest, humble, inquisitive and nuanced exploration into the nature of life (both in the material and mental realm).


### "Cryptonomicon" by Neal Stephenson

<span class="badge badge-info">fiction</span> <span class="badge badge-info">cypherpunk</span> <span class="badge badge-info">crypto</span>
> “Show some fucking adaptability!”

What an epic book. Must-read for people interested in cryptocurrencies. Already a fan of Stephenson since I read [Snow Crash](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40651883-snow-crash) (which inspired Decentraland), I found Cryptonomicon even better. The story is unbelievably prescient and thrilling, and combines mystery, action, and lots of humor. Split between two timelines, this books shows the power of crypto both during WW2 and an imagined future that hits way too close to reality. Probably the best depiction/parody of startup life I read, too.   


### "The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect" by Roger Williams
<img class="book" src="/img/books-2021/3.jpg">
[goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38897904-cryptonomicon)
<span class="badge badge-info">fiction</span> <span class="badge badge-info">singularity</span> <span class="badge badge-info">ai</span>
> "Sometimes the truth is stupid."
A surprising find, this short book is perfect for sci-fi fans. Explores what happens after the singularity when AI exceeds human intelligence. I think I read this thanks to a mention from [George Hotz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hotz) in some interview. Recommended for anyone working on tech.

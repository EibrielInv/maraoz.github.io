I've long wanted to start a tradition of sharing/promoting the best books I read each year. Here's a list of the best books I read in 2021 with a very short review of why I liked them. 

## [What Is Life? by Erwin Schrödinger](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/162780.What_Is_Life_with_Mind_and_Matter_and_Autobiographical_Sketches)
Easily the best book(s) I read in 2021. This edition combines two related works by Schrödinger where the Nobel prize in physics delves into biology and consciousness science. Absolute must-read for anyone mildly interested in figuring out what we are (along the lines of [Darwin's The Origin of Species](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22463.The_Origin_of_Species) and [Dawkins's The Selfish Gene](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61535.The_Selfish_Gene) )

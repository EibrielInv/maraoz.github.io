I've long wanted to start a tradition of sharing the best books I read each year. This year I read a lot, so I have lots to share. End of year also seems like a good time to promote good reading. Here's a list of the best books I read in 2021 with a very short review of why I liked them. 

## [What Is Life? by Erwin Schrödinger](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/162780.What_Is_Life_with_Mind_and_Matter_and_Autobiographical_Sketches)
Easily the best book(s) I read in 2021. This edition combines two related works by Schrödinger where the Nobel prize in physics delves into biology and consciousness science. Absolute must-read for anyone at least mildly interested in figuring out what we are (along the lines of [Darwin's The Origin of Species](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22463.The_Origin_of_Species) and [Dawkins's The Selfish Gene](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61535.The_Selfish_Gene)). An extremely honest, humble, inquisitive and nuanced exploration into the nature of life (both in the material and mental realm). First part of the book reads as a historical mystery thriller, where Schrödinger retells what was known about the physical mechanics of life forms at the time. I heard this book inspired young Watson and Crick to study chromosomes and eventually discover the structure of DNA. The second part of the book dives into the (still to date) confusing and hazy land of consciousness, the mind, and perception. I hope this book inspires someone in our generation to, like Watson and Crick did with DNA, untangle the underlying mechanics of conscioussness.

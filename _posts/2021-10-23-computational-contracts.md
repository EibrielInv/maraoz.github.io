  Summary: Let's use "computational contracts" instead of "smart contracts".

I've been studying and working with [smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) for a long time. I remember learning about them for the first time through [a talk by Mike Hearn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD4L7xDNCmA), former bitcoin developer, which completely blew my brains out. I'm such a fan of the concept that the original name of the company which later became [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/) was Smart Contract Solutions. I've always believed smart contracts would change the world (and I think that already happened), but heck... I also always hated the name "smart contract". With all due respect to Nick Szabo, who coined the term, it sucks. I couldn't ever come up with a convincing alternative, so I [just](https://maraoz.medium.com/smart-contracts-and-bitcoin-a5d61011d9b1) [used](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-smart-contracts-in-ethereum-848f08001f05/) "smart contracts" and swallowed my tears.  

HOWEVER, I recently came accross an alternative which I really liked:  
✨**computational contracts**✨.

It's more precise, unambiguous, complete, and it sounds less like a buzzword. A computational contract is a contract that is defined, enforced, and/or executed computationally. That's it! Clear and simple. 

I know it's probably too late to change how everyone calls ~smart~ computational contracts, but I had to try. 

### Acknowledgements
I first heard "computational contracts" in [Lex Fridman's interview of Stephen Wolfram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-SGpEInX_c).

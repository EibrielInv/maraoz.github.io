This weekend, I did a trip to Yosemite with two good friends, [Esteban][tibi] and [Ryan][ryan]. As happens most times with powerful natural experiences, it sparked really interesting discussions.

This time, the topic was how we thought technology would transform human reality in the next 10 years. We discussed this at length, and created a list of predictions on what we expected to happen. I decided to publish my personal version of that list, which I'll revisit every year to track how we're doing.

<div id="progressbar"><div>0%</div></div>

Without further ado, here goes the list of things I believe will happen before 31 December 2025:

## Space

<input disabled readonly type="checkbox"> At least 1 [asteroid mining mission][asteroid] has economic profit. <br />
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox"> [Mars base in the making][mars], most probably no humans there yet. <br />
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox"> International [moon station][moon] in the making. 

## Artificial Intelligence
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox"> A.I. beats humans at [StarCraft][sc]. <br />
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox"> A.I. beats humans at NASCAR race.<br />
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox"> A.I. beats humans at [flying drone race][drones]. <br />
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox"> A.I. beats humans at [golf][golf]. <br />
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox"> A.I. beats humans at tennis. <br />
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox"> People have ongoing relationships with [chat bots][chatbot] for entertainment. <br />
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox"> Some A.I. is a profitable autonomus economic agent. (e.g. there's a web service, API or site that is running for 1 year without any human aid and is making a profit.) <br />
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox"> Some A.I. generated music "band" has more than 1 million monthly listeners on Spotify or equivalent platform. <br />
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox"> Some A.I. generated painting or visual artwork sells for more than $100k at 2016 value.  <br />

## Robotics and automation
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox">More than a billion people own a [personal autonomous mobile robot for home tasks][roboto]. <br />
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox">[Two-legged robot][atlas] can navigate any terrain as good as a human or better. <br />
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox">Ground transportation and daily commute dominated by self-driving vehicles.<br />
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox">At least 1 million 3d printers are produced in 2025.

## Bio
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox">At least one of Aubrey de Grey's [7 causes of death][7] is "cured" (i.e. we know how to prevent it). <br />
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox">We can perform [some genetic engineering][dogs] on our children before birth for less than $1000 at today's value. <br />
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox">It is possible to use a computer as efficiently as with mouse and keyboard with just a brain interface for the input. Note this prediction doesn't mention price or mass availability of the technology.<br />
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox">[Artificial meat][meat] indistinguishable from real meat and is cheaper to produce. <br />


## Energy
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox">More electric cars are sold in a year than combustion cars. <br />


## Virtual Reality
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox">More than a billion humans own VR equipment. <br />
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox">Some people spend 20+ hours per week in VR.<br />
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox">VR company in top 10 most valuable companies. <br />


## Economy
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox">US dollar collapses (e.g. loses 50% of its value with respect to most other assets)<br />
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox">San Francisco real estate prices go down because remote work becomes ubiquitous. <br />
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox">20%+ unemployment rate in the US (but that's OK). <br />
<input disabled readonly type="checkbox">Average hours per week of work needed by a human to survive drops significantly (at least one order of magnitude) <br />



That's it! I think many points are pretty bold, so I'd be happy if >50% of these turn out to be true. In any case, that would be an amazing world to live in. If you find better ways to formulate the predictions, or have others you think I should consider adding, I'd love to hear it.

See you in 10 years! ;)
